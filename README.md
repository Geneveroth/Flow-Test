# QA SDET Technical Challenge						
1. Please download this zip file and get the "movies-app" running. There are instructions in the zipped README.

Download here: Removed for public repo

2. Write out all Functional Tests Cases you would recommend for the movies application. A Test Case summary is sufficient.

**Please use Page Object Model for writing these.**

3. Now let’s automate some test cases. Scenarios:
  - a) Validate doing a Search works as expected
  - b) Validate autocomplete results are shown within 300ms
  - c) Validate autocomplete result card content
  - d) Validate autocomplete card Image rendered size
  - e) Validate search box is highlighted when clicking on it
  - f) Validate opening Movie page displays correct content (Test will not work but please complete it using POM)
  - g) Validate pasting a Movie name into the textbox and its result
  - h) Validate Searching for a Movie and mocking its result so it’s now called “Flow The Movie”

4. Finally, let’s assume we need to run only Scenario a) in Github Actions. Please write shell script exercise that scenario.
